# React-Pincode production
Production repository for React-Pincode. To see the live app, go to https://react-pincode.netlify.com/

### Prerequisites
* NPM
* NodeJS

### Installing

To set up the project in development, follow the steps:

* `git clone git@github.com:Awesome-React-Modules/React-Pincode-Website.git`
* `cd React-Pincode-Website`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

This would fire up a server to test the project. Then, open up a browser and point it to  http://localhost:3000

## Running the tests

You can run tests by `npm test`, which would launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Deployment

To build the website, run `npm run build` . This would create a new `public` folder, which can be used to deploy the app on a production server.
